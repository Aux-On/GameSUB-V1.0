Dialogue
“Where...?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cave:
“Hello friend!”
“I hope it’s you that’s reading this…”
“I seem to be lost in a cave, so if you could, meet me somewhere brighter.”
“I’ll leave 2 other notes in this cave since I still have more pieces of paper left on me.”
“See you friend!”

“You know, while I am here, I do want to address something that’s been on my mind.”
“I know that you are my best friend, but I hope you find other people to talk to.”
“Not that I don’t want to still hangout with you, but you are always alone, you know?”


“This cave is really creepy. I barely managed to dodge the snake-worm... thingys...”
“They really sting, but just jump over them, and they can't reach you.”
“Remember, even if you are afraid of what’s in the dark…”
“Breathe and step forward, like we have done before.”
	“On a brighter note, I finally see light! It’s quite chilly though.”
	“See you soon hopefully?”

---------------------------------------------------------------
Cold:
“Hello friend!”
“If you made it out of there, you should be in some snowy place.”
“I may not know what you think of this place, but it is relaxing.”
“I could honestly use this as a break, but I’m afraid of frostbite...”
“I’ll leave more notes, so you know where I am!”
“In the meantime, I’m going to explore, feel free to take in the scenery.”
“P.S. be careful of the ghosts, they look nice, but they suck!”

“I do know that you have been feeling quite depressed these days.”
“It's tough to see you stay inside all day.”
“You think people are scary, but what if we work together to face them?”
“Not every person should be too terrible.”
“Someone out there would care about you.”
"Just please try, but don't push yourself."

“I really hope you have been taking in the scenery.”
“This icy weather reminds me-”
“Remember that one time you found an apple still growing in the winter?”
“Then you cooked an apple pie just for you?”
“It was burnt and crispy, but still delicious. Memories like these do warm me.”
“You do feel something is warmer up ahead, see you soon.”
--------------------------------------------------------------

Sun:
“Hello friend.”
“I don’t know why, but this place makes you oddly happy.”
“It’s ordinary, but with no one around to judge you anymore.”
“If only you can live in a rule-less place forever.”

“Oh dear, are you having too much fun now?”
“I’m not going to beat around the bush anymore.”
“I’m not going to run from the truth anymore, like you.”
“You’re pathetic for never reaching out to anyone near you.”
“But then again, would they care?”
“You played video games like this, but no one understood you.”
“How will you escape loneliness if you never let people hear your voice?”
“You must contemplate your dark thoughts.”

“This place reminds you of all the time you put into playing video games.”
“But no one around you liked the things you did.”
“No one bothered to value you.”
“And when they did, you ignored them and continued to play your games.”
“I hope this place makes you contemplate your past.”
“Remember? I’m just your conscience, an imaginary friend.”
“Wake up, you don’t belong with your current state of mind.”
