Dialogue 2.0
(! This is Alex’s diary about her voting plans!”)
Note 1:  (Pollution Potholes)
Dear Diary, I cannot believe I have been writing this diary for 15 years

Well technically, I lost this diary 5 years ago…then forgot to write in it until yesterday…

You, Mr. or Mrs. diary, are probably slightly mad at me right now.

But even so, I have an important decision I need to make

There are many potholes that has been growing around the city and I wonder if I can petition if we can get these fix before any of my friends fall into these bottomless pits…

Note 2:  Dear Diary,

Recently, a new mayor was elected that most of my friends did not vote for, because we did not feel like our votes mattered at all

But this Mayor that shall not be named? She refuses to fill in any of the potholes!

She is instead focused on trying to blow up the potato farms. Sure they have been very rude to us, but if a mayor only listens to the people who vote for her, how can we live?

Note 3: Dear Diary,

I have decided to vote for Mayor Carmen Sadiago

I really like her slogan “Defend the Maidenless”

She’s a MILF  She has some things that I disagree with, but at least she wants to fill the plot holes, potholes, and protect the people.

Even better, she even gave us her name!

I will gather all 2 of my friends to vote for this person, I hope this works.

The Mayor that shall not be named is going DOWN!

(It looks like there are 2 more people I need to secure their votes!)

Rehab Hospitals
Okay, here’s the plan:
(! These are Nora’s text files!)

Note 1: I have been informed that my grandmother is still in the rehabilitation hospital from her opioid addiction.

She however cannot leave the hospital and the hospital is planned to be destroyed

I may be ice cold to everyone, but she is the only warmth in my world

I need to make sure she will leave and be safe

Or I will not have anything to live for.

Note 2:
I had thought politics was something only grandmothers loved to do Something quite boring and unwelcoming

But since my grandmother’s coma from her addiction, I have been working hard to pay all the taxes

But this… “mayor”

She must be eradicated.

She is the person who wants to harm my grandmother.

She will not see the light of victory soon.

Note 3:

My eccentric friend brought up the idea to vote for a new mayor soon.

I have a plan. I initially was going to dispose and make the current mayor “move away”

But this plan is genius.

If I can stop this person from destroying the rehabilitation hospital, I will finish this by legal means. I will need to get our last friend in this plan.

(!Alright! One more person!)

Parent and clubs involvement, funding? Tiger parents?
(! These are… I have no idea what this is… let’s just get on with it. -__-)

Note 1: So anyways, I am SO going to lose my marbles soon

Like, yeah, my 5 children are how old are they? 30 In Kindergarten I think that's the right age, I don’t freaking know.

But like, the school they go to used to get government funding and we might starve soon without the free reduced lunch

I might have to apply for food stamps and that’s like, extremely shameful

I hope I can feed my children soon

Note 2:

This mayor, I want to SLAP her, she has been the one cutting the funding to the school!!

Not only that but the chess club stopped being funded, shutting down many clubs and now I have to deal with my children longer!

And also they now don’t let me watch my children and allow me be a Tiger Mom

SO NOT FAIR

Maybe I should not have skipped out voting my entire life. I thought it was only for rich people only, and been too lazy to actually figure out how it works

Note 3: Nevermind, my creepy friend told me how voting works, and I think I will vote for Carmen

She is such a role model, and what I want my children to be like exactly like her

With her help, maybe we can make sure no one else will starve in this city!

Let’s go Girl Boss!!

Ending: (Okay, that should be it. Let’s hope Mayor Carmen Sandiago Santiago Sandiego wins!)

Dialogue
“Where...?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cave:
“Hello friend!”
“I hope it’s you that’s reading this…”
“I seem to be lost in a cave, so if you could, meet me somewhere brighter.”
“I’ll leave 2 other notes in this cave since I still have more pieces of paper left on me.”
“See you friend!”

“You know, while I am here, I do want to address something that’s been on my mind.”
“I know that you are my best friend, but I hope you find other people to talk to.”
“Not that I don’t want to still hangout with you, but you are always alone, you know?”


“This cave is really creepy. I barely managed to dodge the snake-worm... thingys...”
“They really sting, but just jump over them, and they can't reach you.”
“Remember, even if you are afraid of what’s in the dark…”
“Breathe and step forward, like we have done before.”
	“On a brighter note, I finally see light! It’s quite chilly though.”
	“See you soon hopefully?”

---------------------------------------------------------------
Cold:
“Hello friend!”
“If you made it out of there, you should be in some snowy place.”
“I may not know what you think of this place, but it is relaxing.”
“I could honestly use this as a break, but I’m afraid of frostbite...”
“I’ll leave more notes, so you know where I am!”
“In the meantime, I’m going to explore, feel free to take in the scenery.”
“P.S. be careful of the ghosts, they look nice, but they suck!”

“I do know that you have been feeling quite depressed these days.”
“It's tough to see you stay inside all day.”
“You think people are scary, but what if we work together to face them?”
“Not every person should be too terrible.”
“Someone out there would care about you.”
"Just please try, but don't push yourself."

“I really hope you have been taking in the scenery.”
“This icy weather reminds me-”
“Remember that one time you found an apple still growing in the winter?”
“Then you cooked an apple pie just for you?”
“It was burnt and crispy, but still delicious. Memories like these do warm me.”
“You do feel something is warmer up ahead, see you soon.”
--------------------------------------------------------------

Sun:
“Hello friend.”
“I don’t know why, but this place makes you oddly happy.”
“It’s ordinary, but with no one around to judge you anymore.”
“If only you can live in a rule-less place forever.”

“Oh dear, are you having too much fun now?”
“I’m not going to beat around the bush anymore.”
“I’m not going to run from the truth anymore, like you.”
“You’re pathetic for never reaching out to anyone near you.”
“But then again, would they care?”
“You played video games like this, but no one understood you.”
“How will you escape loneliness if you never let people hear your voice?”
“You must contemplate your dark thoughts.”

“This place reminds you of all the time you put into playing video games.”
“But no one around you liked the things you did.”
“No one bothered to value you.”
“And when they did, you ignored them and continued to play your games.”
“I hope this place makes you contemplate your past.”
“Remember? I’m just your conscience, an imaginary friend.”
“Wake up, you don’t belong with your current state of mind.”
