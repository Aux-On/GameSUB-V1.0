Easy+ 2.) Movement of mobs in a pattern and push back

3.) (For myself) Music figure out what fits or not

4.) Dialogue
5.) Inventory (Honestly not needed with how short game is)
6.) Sound sfx? (cave for like water dripping)
7.) Burning Car cutscene but top priority is first 3 levels!
8.) Weather effects for Snow (if possible)
9.) Is the isometric/RPG plan still going?
10.) Will Sticky Notes disappear after being interacted with?
11.) Also double check if my tiles look okay please! And I notice the cave tile used in Level 3?

Dialogue:
EACH SPACE = 1 STICkY NOTE

“Where...?”
Cave:
“Hello friend!”
“I hope it’s you that’s reading this…”
“I seem to be lost in some sort of cave, so if you could, meet me somewhere brighter, I’m heading off.”
“I’ll leave 2 other notes in this cave since I still have more pieces of paper left on me.”
“See you friend.”

“You know, while I am here, I do want to talk to you about something that has been bothering me.”
“I know I consider you to be my best friend, but I really hope you can find someone else to be friends with.”
“Not that I don’t want to still be with you, but you are always alone, you know?”

“This cave is really creepy. I hope you have managed to dodge the snake-worm…thingys…”
“They really sting, but just jump over them, they can’t jump very high.”
“Remember, even if you are afraid of what’s in the dark, close your eyes, breathe, then walk forward.”
“I'll do the same in the meanwhile, I feel like a cold light is nearby, bring a coat if you got one.”
"see you friend."


Cold:
“Hello friend!”
“If you made it out of the darkness, it looks like we are in some snowy place.”
“I don’t know what you think, but it feels relaxing.”
“I could honestly walk around and use this as a break, but I think I’m getting some frostbite…”
“I’ll leave more notes so you know where I have been, perhaps you can see what I'm seeing?”
“Stay safe, don't worry about me but about yourself.”

“You know, I do know that you have been feeling quite depressed these days.”
“It's tough for me to see you stay inside all day.”
“I think people are scary too, but you have to face them.”
“Maybe if we work together people won’t be that bad.”
“Just remember to talk to anyone besides me please?”
“P.S. be careful of the ghosts, they suck!”

““I hope you remembered to breathe and relax to the snowy scene.”
“Remember that one time you found an apple still growing in the winter?”
"Then you made a decent burnt-and-crispy apple pie?"
“Perhaps like that apple, you can still live even through this cold weather.”
"Then nourish yourself into something edible and good, like you always have for you."
“I do feel something is warmer up ahead, see you soon.”


Sun:
“Hello friend.”
“I don’t know why, but this place makes you oddly happy.”
“It’s ordinary, but with no one to judge you anymore.”
“If only you can live in a rule-less place forever.”

“I’m not going to beat around the bush anymore.”
“Do you remember all the times you froze whenever anyone talked to you?”
“And you ignored them?”
“How will you get away from loneliness if you never let people hear your voice?”
“You must face these fears if you want to progress, you know?”

“This place reminds you of all the time you put into playing video games.”
"The fun, happy, sunny place of warmth"
"The only warmth in your life"
“But no one around you felt the same way about video games.”
“No one bothered to notice your passion.”
“When they did you ignored them and continued to play your games.”
“I hope this place makes you contemplate your past.”
“Remember? I’m just your conscience as your imaginary friend.”
Ending:
“...”
